# Useing a Low-cost ‘Artificial Nose’ to Classify Food and Drink Types
# Proposed Aim:
Critical analysis of existing low-cost FaD sensor, devices, systems and scenarios.
(Technical performance evaluation, cost-benefit analysis and application field)
Requirements and design of a low-cost FaD sensing and analysis system.
(System functional requirements, performance indicators and scalability)
Implementation of a low-cost FaD sensing and analysis system.
Testing / evaluation of a low-cost FaD sensing and analysis system. 
# Rationale
Quality control in the food and beverage industry: Real-time quality control can be carried out in food and beverage production by developing low-cost and efficient artificial nose technology. This is crucial for detecting the freshness, odor or other quality problems of food, and helps to improve the quality of products.
Dietary needs of special groups: Some people have special dietary needs for health reasons or personal beliefs, such as sensitivity to allergens. Artificial noses can be used to detect and identify these components, helping to ensure that products meet the needs of special groups.
Environmental monitoring and risk prevention: In food and beverage production environments, some odors or volatile compounds may be indicators that are harmful to the health of workers. Artificial noses can be used to monitor these environmental variables and detect potential risks in advance.
